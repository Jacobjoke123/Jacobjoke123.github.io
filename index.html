    <div class="center textbox">
        <p><br><br>&emsp;&emsp; I coded this website myself as a challenge because wanted to see if I could make something better than what you can get by using a free website builder. I taught myself html and css so I hope this website can help sell me a little bit more as a person and help show off some of my skills and abilities.<br><br>THANKS!</p>
